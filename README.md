### Data Pipeline 

### Data Preprocessing

In this project, data preprocessing is a critical step to ensure high-quality input data for our machine learning models, ultimately enhancing the accuracy of demand forecasting for Bluebikes. Below are the key steps involved in preprocessing the data:

1. **Data Collection**  
   We begin by downloading trip data from the official Bluebikes website’s S3 buckets. This data includes information on individual bike trips, such as start and end times, bike type, trip duration, and station details.
   We are also scraping a [weather website](https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ma/east-boston/KBOS/date/) to get Boston's weather on an hourly basis. This weather data is then intgerated with trip history data based on the hour the ride was taken on a particular day. This is all done via AirFlow.

2. **Data Type Conversion**  
   To facilitate effective analysis, specific fields are converted to appropriate data types:
   - **Date fields**: Converted to a readable datetime format for temporal analysis.
   - **Categorical fields**: Fields such as membership type and bike type are transformed to categorical types to optimize storage and computation during modeling.

3. **Temporal Feature Extraction**  
   From the trip start and end times, we derive additional temporal features that enhance forecasting accuracy:
   - **Year, month, day, hour**: To capture seasonal, monthly, weekly, and hourly patterns.
   - **Day name**: Useful for distinguishing between weekday and weekend usage.
   - **Trip duration**: Calculated in minutes to assess trip lengths and categorize short vs. long trips.

4. **Handling Missing and Invalid Data**  
   - **Dropping Missing Station IDs**: Rows with missing station IDs are removed to maintain data integrity, as station IDs are crucial for demand forecasting.
   - **Trip Duration Validation**: Trips with a duration less than 5 minutes or exceeding 1440 minutes (24 hours) are excluded.
   - **Trip Distance Validation**: Trips with a distance of less than 0 km are considered invalid and removed.

5. **Data Upload to GCP**  
   After preprocessing, the cleaned dataset is uploaded to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This allows for scalable data storage and facilitates downstream model training and deployment within the MLOps pipeline.

These preprocessing steps ensure that our data is relevant, consistent, and robust, improving the overall performance and reliability of the demand forecasting model.

### Unit testing

1. **Monthly URL Generation:**
Dynamically generates URLs for monthly Bluebikes data files.

2. **Data Download & Extraction:**
Downloads and extracts data, with fallback to previous months if the file is missing.

3. **Data Quality Tests:**

**Missing Values:** Checks for acceptable levels of missing values in critical columns.
- **Column Data Types:** Validates key column types (e.g., ride_id as string, started_at as datetime).
- **Date Format:** Ensures dates follow YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
- **Trip Duration:** Confirms non-negative trip durations.
- **Latitude & Longitude:** Validates coordinates are within range.
- **Unique Ride IDs:** Ensures ride_id values are unique.
- **Membership Type:** Checks member_casual only has member or casual.

### Alerts

Email alerts are configured to notify the owner whenever any task fails. This setup provides proactive monitoring for critical points in the data pipeline, helping maintain seamless data operations.   
- **Ingestion Task Alerts**: Alerts here are essential, as they provide immediate notification if data cannot be fetched from the source (Bluebikes)
- **Preprocessing Task Alerts**: Email alerts during preprocessing allow for swift intervention. This is critical because preprocessing often involves data validation, cleaning, and transformation steps; without real-time alerts, errors could go unnoticed and lead to incorrect final data output.
- **Uploading to Remote GCS Bucket Alerts**: Failure alerts for this task help identify connectivity issues, permissions errors, or storage capacity problems. Immediate notifications, the owner can address these issues without delay, ensuring that data is successfully stored and accessible for future use to prevent data loss. 

### Usage

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   Run the data ingestion pipeline manually or schedule it in Apache Airflow.
   ```bash
   python src/data_pipeline.py
   ```

2. **Train the Model:**
   Train the model using the preprocessed data.
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

3. **Make Predictions:**

   docker run -p 8000:8000 bluebikes-api
   ```
## Model Pipeline

### Data loading
The ride history data is retrieved from a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) bucket, where each month's processed and cleaned ride history is stored. This data is integrated with scraped weather data to create the final dataset, which serves as the input for training machine learning models. The entire process ensures that the data pipeline efficiently handles the pre-processing, versioning, and integration of the various data sources, providing a reliable foundation for model development.

### Model Training and Selection
The dataset is split into 70% for training, 15% for testing, and 15% for validation to ensure robust model evaluation. Various models, including Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, were trained and evaluated for performance. Hyperparameter tuning was performed on these models to identify the optimal configuration. The best-performing model, based on the defined evaluation metrics, was selected for further use.

### Model Validation
The model validation process involves evaluating performance using relevant metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) to assess model accuracy and fit. Validation is conducted on a hold-out dataset that was not used during the training phase, ensuring an unbiased evaluation of the model's generalization ability. These metrics are crucial in selecting the best-performing model for the task.

### Model Registry
Once the best model has been selected and validated, including completing any necessary bias checks, the model is pushed to a model registry for version control and to ensure reproducibility. In this case,the trained model is pushed to model registry of VertexAI and the associated Docker image to Google Cloud Artifact Registry. This process ensures that the model is properly versioned, facilitating easy access for future updates, deployments, and monitoring. Storing the model in the registry enhances collaboration, supports model governance, and provides a reliable means of tracking the model's lifecycle throughout its deployment stages.

### Model Retraining
The model retraining process is automated through a GitHub Actions workflow, which is triggered by a push event to the tracked DVC directory. This workflow invokes an endpoint on Google Cloud Run, initiating the execution of the training script. Upon completion, the updated model is pushed to the artifacts registry, and key performance metrics are recorded for further analysis.

### Monitoring and Logging
The system is set up to use **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring, with **ELK Stack** or **GCP Stackdriver** for logging.

###  Bias Analysis For bias analysis

Most Frequent Station: The model's performance was evaluated on data filtered to the most frequently occurring station.
Least Frequent Station: Similarly, the least frequent station was used for comparison.

Bias analysis aims to evaluate and address disparities in model performance across different subsets of the data. In this project, bias was analyzed based on station frequency and bike types to ensure the model performed equitably across all scenarios.

Most Frequent Station
The model's performance was assessed on data from the most frequently occurring station. This subset typically contains a larger volume of data, which often leads to higher model accuracy due to the abundance of training samples. The higher representation of this station allowed the model to learn patterns effectively, resulting in improved metrics such as reduced Mean Squared Error (MSE) and higher R² scores.

Least Frequent Station
Conversely, data from the least frequent station posed a greater challenge due to its limited representation in the dataset. Models trained without addressing this imbalance struggled to generalize effectively for this subset, leading to lower accuracy. However, targeted sampling strategies were employed to increase the representation of this station during training, improving accuracy from 86% to 89%. This highlights the impact of bias-aware techniques in enhancing performance for underrepresented groups.

Key Takeaway
Bias analysis revealed that without intervention, the model favored data-rich subsets like the most frequent station. By addressing this bias through targeted sampling, the model achieved more balanced performance, demonstrating the importance of equitable data distribution in machine learning applications.
